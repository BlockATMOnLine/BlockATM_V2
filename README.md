# BlockATM Introduction

### Introduction

BlcokATM is the world's first decentralized payment protocol, built on blockchain smart contract technology to create a payment solution that does not involve centralized institutions and is not controlled by them. It changes the traditional payment industry's asset custody and control, allowing businesses to fully control their assets, ensuring 100% security.

### What is decentralization?

Decentralization refers to the process or design concept of dispersing power, control, or functions from a single central authority to multiple independent individuals, nodes, or entities. In the context of technology and blockchain, decentralization is often associated with distributed networks aimed at eliminating reliance on intermediaries or central institutions, enhancing system transparency, security, and resistance to censorship.\
The main difference between decentralized payment gateways and centralized payment gateways lies in the fact that funds are held in smart contracts on the blockchain rather than being held by centralized institutions. Therefore, fund withdrawals and transfers have no limits on amount or time restrictions and do not require permission.

### What is a smart contract

Smart contracts are automated, executable computer programs that run on the blockchain. They automatically execute contract terms when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. The core idea of smart contracts is to implement the terms of traditional contracts through code, with features such as transparency, immutability, and decentralization (no need for trusted third parties or guarantees from institutions, naturally secure and reliable).

The smart contracts of BlockATM are created independently by enterprises and owned by enterprise administrator wallet addresses.

### Our values

BlockATM aims to use blockchain smart contract technology and features (such as public transparency, tamper resistance, and trustlessness) to provide enterprises with a secure cryptocurrency payment solution that does not require verification to establish trust and allows for self-custody of assets. This will actively promote the development of decentralized finance (Defi) industry based on this foundation.



### Our vision

The vision of BlockATM is to become the preferred decentralized payment protocol provider for enterprises that actively embrace cryptocurrency.
