# Core Advantage

### Self-hosted smart contract, assets 100% secure

The smart contract created by the enterprise on BlockATM belongs to the enterprise, publicly transparent and tamper-proof on the blockchain, and the enterprise has complete control over the management rights of the contract.\
The assets of the enterprise are self-managed by smart contracts. Only the "authorized signature address" designated by the enterprise can withdraw assets from the smart contract to a specified "asset receiving address", and no centralized institution, including BlockATM, has permission to withdraw other than that.

### Safe payment

Users authorize smart contracts to execute transactions through connecting their wallets, ensuring security and reliability while avoiding errors in payment amounts or recipient addresses.

### No need for KYB, KYC.

BlockATM is a DApp running on the blockchain, allowing enterprises to operate without submitting KYB or KYC information to the government or centralized institutions.

### No restrictions

There is no limit on the amount or time for asset extraction.

### No permission required

Asset extraction does not require permission from centralized institutions.

### Transparent and fixed fees
