# Create Collection Contract

There are two types of Collection Contracts: Web3 Collection Contract and Scan2Pay Contract. Both types are used for token collection, but they differ in the payment method. The Web3 Collection Contract provides a wallet connection for authorized transactions, while the Scan2Pay Contract offers a payment method through QR code scanning and transfer.

### Create Web3 Collection Contract

On the Collection Contract - Web3 Collection Contract page, click the "Create Now" button.

After entering the information, click "Create" (Note: Make sure you have 200 USDT and enough Gas Fee ready; if either USDT or Gas Fee is insufficient, the contract cannot be created).

After clicking "Create," your wallet will prompt for USDT expenditure authorization (the service fee for creating the contract).

Next, sign and confirm your agreement to deploy the smart contract, and then wait for the blockchain to confirm the transaction.

Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the Web3 Collection Contract will be successfully created. The popup will close, and you will see the newly created contract on the list page.

### Create Scan2Pay Contract

When creating a Scan2Pay Contract, you need to specify the "Authorized Signer Address" and the associated "Asset Receiving Address." This means that the creation of a Scan2Pay Contract requires first creating a Web3 Collection Contract.
