Once the information is entered, click "Create" (Note: Make sure you have 200 USDT and sufficient Gas Fee prepared in advance; otherwise, the contract cannot be created).

After clicking "Create," the wallet will be prompted to authorize the USDT expenditure (for the contract creation service fee).

Next, sign and confirm to agree to deploy the smart contract, and then wait for the blockchain to confirm the transaction completion.

Once the blockchain confirmation is complete and the transaction is finished, the Payout Contract will be successfully created. The popup will close, and the newly created contract will appear in the list page.
