# Permission Description

### There are three types of role addresses in the BlockATM platform: Owner  Address, Authorized Signer Address, and Operator Address

* Owner Address: The wallet that creates the smart contract serves as the admin, responsible for managing the smart contract and the cashier system.
* Authorized Signer Address: Set by the owner during smart contract creation, this address is responsible for managing contract assets, including withdrawals, deposits, and payouts.
* Operator Address: After creating a cashier, the owner can assign operator addresses to it. These addresses are responsible for managing cashier orders, including handling missing orders and resending Webhook notifications.
