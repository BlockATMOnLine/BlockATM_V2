# Batch Payout

Crypto enterprises' customers often have withdrawal needs. Currently, the common way for enterprises to handle customer withdrawals is to use wallets for transfers, which can be cumbersome and prone to errors during batch transfers. At the same time, they may face issues with insufficient Gas Fees. To address this, we offer a [payout contract](fu-bi-zhi-neng-he-yue.md) to achieve batch payout functionality, simplify payment operations, reduce error rates, and cover Gas Fees on behalf of the enterprise to improve payment efficiency.
