# Payout Contract

The payout contract is used for bulk payouts, with the payout request initiated and signed by the "Authorized Signature Address" specified in the contract. The payout operation is then executed by the BlockATM payout proxy contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a payout contract, the "Authorized Signature Address" must be specified. Once specified and the contract is successfully created, it cannot be modified, ensuring the security of the contractâ€™s assets.
{% endhint %}
