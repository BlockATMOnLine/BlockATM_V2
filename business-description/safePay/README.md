# Safely Collection

BlockATM provides enterprises with the ability to receive crypto payments through a self-hosted [collection contract](shou-bi-zhi-neng-he-yue.md). Users can authorize smart contract transactions by connecting their wallets or by transferring funds through scanning QR codes. The encrypted assets from the transaction are directly transferred to the enterprise's coin collection contract, and only the "authorized signature address" specified by the enterprise can withdraw assets from the contract to the designated "asset receiving address". No centralized institution has permission to withdraw assets other than this.
