# Collection Contract

Collection contract is divided into two types: Web3 collection contract, Scan2pay contract.

### Web3 collection contract

The Web3 collection contract provides a secure and reliable way to collect coins. Users can connect their wallets and authorize smart contracts to automatically execute transactions for payment. The encrypted currency paid by users is directly transferred to the Web3 collection contract, and only the "authorized signature address" specified in the contract has permission to withdraw funds, which can only be withdrawn to the "asset receiving address" specified in the contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a web3 collection contract, you need to specify the authorized signature address and asset receiving address. Once specified and the contract is successfully created, it cannot be modified to ensure the security of the contract assets.
{% endhint %}

### Scan2pay contract

The scan2pay contract provides a convenient and fast way to collect coin payments. Users can transfer payments by scanning the QR code of the receiving address with their mobile wallet. Only the "authorized signature address" specified in the contract has permission to withdraw coins, and can only be withdrawn to the "asset receiving address" specified in the contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a scan2pay contract, you need to specify the authorized signature address and asset receiving address. However, the asset receiving address of the scan code receiving coin contract must be a Web3 collection contract address, which means that the premise of creating a scan2pay contract is to first create a Web3 collection contract.
{% endhint %}

### Historical contract version

### V2

April 17, 2025

* The main body of the independent cashier, decoupling the collection contract from the cashier, allowing enterprises to independently decide on the collection contract associated with the cashier.
* Change the rules of receiving fees: change from deducting from the deposit to collecting from the balance of the receiving contract, reducing business expansion costs.

### V1

July 10, 2023

* The collection contract specifies the authorized signature address and asset receiving address, only the authorized signature address has permission to withdraw contract assets to the asset receiving address.
