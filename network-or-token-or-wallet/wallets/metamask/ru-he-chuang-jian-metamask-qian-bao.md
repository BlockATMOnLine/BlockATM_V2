# How to create a MetaMask wallet

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Download the MetaMask extension or app

* If using on a computer, MetaMask is a browser extension that supports browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Visit the official website ([https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)), click the "Download" button, and select the browser version you are using to install.
* If using on a mobile device, you can search for "MetaMask" in the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android) to download the official app.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### After installation, open MetaMask

* After installing the extension, click the MetaMask icon (fox icon) in the top-right corner of your browser, or open the mobile app.
* When you open it for the first time, you will see the welcome screen. Click "Get Started."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select "Create a New Wallet"

* The system will ask whether you want to "Create a New Wallet" or "Import an Existing Wallet." Choose "Create a New Wallet."
* Read and agree to the terms of use.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set a password

* Enter a secure password (at least 8 characters, preferably including letters, numbers, and symbols). This password will be used to unlock your MetaMask wallet.
* Confirm your password and click "Create."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Backup the recovery phrase

* MetaMask will generate a 12-word recovery phrase (Secret Recovery Phrase). This is the only way to recover your wallet.
* Click to reveal the recovery phrase, write it down, and store it in a secure place (it is recommended to write it by hand on paper, and avoid taking screenshots or storing it on connected devices).
* Follow the prompts to enter the words in order to confirm that you have backed them up correctly, then click "Confirm."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Complete the setup

* After confirming the backup, your MetaMask wallet is created! You will see the main wallet interface, displaying your account address (a string starting with 0x).
* By default, MetaMask connects to the Ethereum Mainnet. You can switch networks as needed (such as Arbitrum, testnets, etc.).
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Important Notes

* Security: Never share your recovery phrase or private key with anyone. Anyone asking for this information could be attempting a scam.
* Fund Addition: After creating the wallet, you need to deposit cryptocurrency into your wallet address through a transfer (e.g., from an exchange) in order to use it.
* Use Cases: MetaMask can be used to interact with decentralized applications (DApps), such as DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and more.
