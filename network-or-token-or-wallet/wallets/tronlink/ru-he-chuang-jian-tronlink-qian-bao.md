# How to create a TronLink wallet

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to compatibility issues with Tron network wallets, some wallets may not be able to connect to the TronLink app via WalletConnect. Until the Tron network wallets are upgraded and these compatibility issues are resolved, BlockATM recommends using the TronLink browser extension for connection. The following guide focuses solely on using the TronLink browser extension.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Download the TronLink extension

* Visit the official TronLink website ([https://www.tronlink.org/](https://www.tronlink.org/)).
* Click "Download" and select the version compatible with your browser (only supports Chrome and Edge).
* Click "Add to Browser" or a similar button in the browser's extension store to install the extension.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open TronLink

* Once the installation is complete, click the TronLink icon in the top right corner of the browser.
* When opening for the first time, click "Create Wallet."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set the wallet name and password

* Enter a wallet name (optional, for easy identification).
* Set a secure password (at least 8 characters, recommended to include letters, numbers, and symbols) to unlock your wallet.
* Click "Next."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Backup the mnemonic phrase

* TronLink will generate a 12-word mnemonic phrase, which is the key to recovering your wallet.
* Click to display the mnemonic phrase, write it down, and store it safely (it is recommended to write it by hand on paper, not to take screenshots or store it on connected devices).
* Enter the words in order for verification, and once completed, click "Confirm."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Creation complete

* After setup is complete, you will see the main wallet interface, displaying your wallet address (a string of characters starting with "T").
* At this point, the wallet has been created and is by default connected to the TRON mainnet.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Important Notes

* Security: The mnemonic phrase is the only credential to recover your wallet. If lost, it cannot be recovered, and if exposed, it may lead to theft of your assets. Be sure to store it safely.
* Fund Addition: After creating the wallet, the address is empty. You need to transfer TRX or other tokens from an exchange or another wallet to use it.
* Use: TronLink can be used to store TRX, TRC-10, and TRC-20 tokens, and interact with DApps (decentralized applications) in the TRON ecosystem.
